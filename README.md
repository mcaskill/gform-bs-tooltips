Gravity Forms / Bootstrap Tooltips
==================================

Adds frontend-support for Bootstrap-powered [Tooltips](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips) and [Popovers](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers) to form controls.

For each form control, this plugin adds two custom fields under the "Advanced" tab to control the *Title* and the *Content* of the tooltip.

Only the Popover component is supported at the moment.
